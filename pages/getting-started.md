## Basic structure

### Components

Components, like buttons and alerts, can be assembled together to build applications.

### Layouts

Layouts are generic tools that allow you to structure and organize the content on your pages.

## Additional tools

### Utilities

Utilities are a set of classes that enable you to further customize and modify elements in your project without having to write any custom CSS.

For example, you might use a utility class to add additional spacing between elements, align content in a layout, or even add a box shadow to an element.

## Released vs Unreleased

Our components, assemblies, and page examples are labelled with either a <span class="pf-c-label label-released">released</span> or <span class="pf-c-label label-unreleased">unreleased</span> marker, easily signifying their status on developers.redhat.com. Anything with the <span class="pf-c-label label-unreleased">unreleased</span> label should be considered a work-in-progress and not recommended for use in production.
