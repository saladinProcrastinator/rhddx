## The RHDDX site

The RHDDX site is the reference environment for developers.redhat.com. We strive to keep this site as up-to-date as possible but occasionally differences arrise between here and developers.redhat.com. If you find an error/difference/concern, feel free to report and issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/redhat-developer/developers.redhat.com/issues) page.
