# RHDDX Frontend Documentation Site


## Local Development

All processes are controlled through Node/Gulp. As such, clone this repository and run:

```bash
npm install
gulp development
```
Jekyll will watch your project folder for changes.

Now navigate to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) to preview the site, and
[localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) to log into the CMS.

## Bug reports, feature requests, etc

This is an ongoing project and I welcome contributions. Feel free to submit a PR.

If you need any help with setting up Netlify CMS, you can reach out to the Netlify team in the [Netlify CMS Gitter](https://gitter.im/netlify/netlifycms).
